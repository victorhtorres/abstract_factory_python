# Abstract factory example in Python
This is a example that you can read on post [towardsdatascience.com](https://towardsdatascience.com/python-factories-for-scalable-reusable-and-elegant-code-1358ea06936d),
but with some minus attrs, static typing and more POO implemented. Additionality, a class diagram for the project:

Implemented on Python 3.9+

Have fun ;)
